<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>
I am an IT professional, troubleshooting things is what I do everyday. Sometimes I can remember things.
But a lot of time I have to google for some problems I may experience in the past. So it would be nice to have a
place to collect my troubleshooting notes, so next time when it happens, I can quickly find the solution
in stead of google again.
</p>
<p>This website is created mainly for this purpose: to help me collecting my work notes. So it will become
a knowledge base for me. Whenever needed, I know where to find the solutions. The website is going to be 
categorized by the following topics:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt><b><a href="fog.html">FOG</a></b></dt>
	<dd><p>An imaging tool I used to clone lab computers.</p></dd>
	<dt><b><a href="matlab.html">MATLAB</a></b></dt>
	<dd><p>I manage the license server, so problems I encountered are mainly about 
		the license server setup.
	</p></dd>
	<dt><b>Linux in General</b></dt>
	<dd><p>Most our lab computers are Linux systems. There are many little tricks to configure the
		lab environment. I would like to add this category in the future.
	</p></dd>
	<dt><b>Group Policy</b></dt>
	<dd><p>We have some Windows systems used by office staff, so I would like to document how to use 
		proper group policy to manage users and deploy software.
